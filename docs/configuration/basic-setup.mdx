# Basic Configuration

This guide will help you create your first gateway configuration and understand the basic concepts.

As a first step, create the `config.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
routes:
  gpt-pirate-route:
    chat_models:
      - model_id: 'gpt-pirate'
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o'
        credentials:
          api_key: '<YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY>'
        system_prompt: 'You are a pirate!'
```

This creates a route named `gpt-pirate-route` that points to `gpt-4o`, specifying the OpenAI API Key and a system prompt.

Once the gateway is started, you will need to access the UI (http://localhost:9000) to view route information, create a group and a key, and finally, associate the group with the route.

Go to the `Groups` section to create the group, and then to the `API Key` section to create the key. 

**Remember that the key will be visible only once, so handle it with care and save it securely.** 

As a final step, you will need to associate the group with the route and the key. In this way, we are establishing that the `pirate-crew` group holds the key to authenticate to the `gpt-pirate-route`.

Next, you will need to instantiate the model client by specifying the `base_url`, using the route instead of the `model` name, and using the `api_key` retrieved from the gateway UI.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI(
    base_url='http://localhost:9000/v1',
    model='gpt-pirate-route'
    api_key='sk-rb-******',
)
```

From this moment on, input and output traffic for this model will pass through the gateway.

**Congratulations, you have configured the gateway and integrated it into your application!**
